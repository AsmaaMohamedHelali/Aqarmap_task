1-I used butterknife library for binding resources in layout to save time as it is so easy and clear.
2-I used RXjava observable with retrofit for getting API request because of multiple requests of search filter lists in home screen
3-I used picaso for downloading image as it so easy and faster than other methodes
4-I used RadioRealButton for radio button as it has good UI 
5-I used RTLMaterialSpinner for spinner purposes as it has good UI and simple implementation
